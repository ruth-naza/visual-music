## Visual Music WebApp
An app that converts your favorite music pieces into visual expressions. 

Visual Music is a collaboration project managed by a group of dedicated fellow students. Aimed at all music and arts lovers, it provides the users with a real time visual transcription of a streamed music piece. 

If the visual transcription can be at first of random assignment of colors and shapes, it shouldn't remain so, as **one of the main interest is to transcribe the emotional effects of the music piece**. Therefore, questions will araise as perception is highly cultural and language induced. It might be interesting in a second time to create various themes based on those considerations for the visual transcription.

## Applications
The applications could be :
* the possibility to screen the visual expression as background for parties, concerts and stages, 
* accessibility, by giving a visual transcription of music pieces, making them accessible to the hearing impaired,
* creation of original objects, with the possibility of a screen capture going with a downloadable HD print file, the possibility of printing, framing and offering the painting of a song to friends and family,
* tool or interesting experiment for musicologists, linguists, scientists, etc.

## Technology/Stack:
* [Figma](https://www.figma.com/): to design the UI
* [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/): to test and export the components for React
* [React](https://reactjs.org/): to build the UI
* [p5](https://p5js.org/): for visualization
   * using [react-p5-wrapper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-p5-wrapper))
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): to run and deploy the app
* [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/): continuous integration service used to build and test projects hosted at GitHub
  
__Idea:__ We want to analyse the data from an uploaded mp3 song, and process it through p5.js. We are not building a player, and not building a simple visualizer: we want to think on how to transcribe the music in an artistic way - the emotions, patterns, etc. Challenges have to be solved but it could mean working on rhythms, beats, melodies, frequencies, loops, etc.

## Current tasks and challenges
#### Design
* Design of the app on Figma
* Create the logo
* Create "React friendly" components with Storybook

#### Write documentation and wikis based on the stack
* Write a PR Guide for contributors
* Set up the "All-Contributors" on GitHub repo

#### Frontend, DSP, visualization
* Dive into p5 using a component to output visuals while playing the sound
* Give user the possibility to export and download the visualization as HD print file.

#### Backend
* Upload song to Firebase
* User authentification
* Remember user on the local/session storage, to prevent re-sign in every refresh.

### Please check the Trello board, as tasks evolve continuously

__Miscellaneous questions__
* How do we receive and parse the data? Can we take waveform data about a song and turn it into a drawing through some interpretation of the waveforms? Else?              
* What kind of processing would we need to perform? Processing before storing the data because there will be too many points: we probably need to divide them into chunks and clean the data / simplify it.                 
* How to play music and do visualization at the same time?
